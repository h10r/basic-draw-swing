Basic Draw App - Swing
================

This is the simple drawing application developed for the [Interaction Programing course](https://www.kth.se/social/course/DH2641/) with the purpose to demonstrate the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) principles in Java Swing. 

**Important!** This project depends on [another project](https://github.com/kth-csc-iprog/basic-draw-app-java-model) that implements the the model of the application.
